  summary: "Victor Frankenstein, a brilliant scientist, discovers the secret to creating life and assembles a creature from dead body parts. However, he is horrified by his creation's appearance and abandons it. The intelligent but isolated creature, rejected by society, seeks revenge on his creator. The creature kills Victor's younger brother, best friend, and bride, driving Victor to pursue his creation to the Arctic. The novel ends with Victor's death and the creature's declared intention to end its own life, devastated by the destruction it has caused.",
