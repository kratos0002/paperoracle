  summary: "Heart of Darkness follows Charles Marlow, a sailor who takes on an assignment from a Belgian trading company to captain a steamboat up the Congo River. His mission is to retrieve Kurtz, an ivory trader who has established himself as a demigod among the local population. As Marlow travels deeper into the African continent, he witnesses the brutal exploitation of African natives by European colonial powers. When he finally meets Kurtz, Marlow finds a man who has fully embraced the darkness of human nature, having abandoned all civilized restraint. Before dying, Kurtz utters his final words: 'The horror! The horror!' Returning to Europe, Marlow is left to grapple with the profound moral emptiness at the heart of imperialism and human existence.",
