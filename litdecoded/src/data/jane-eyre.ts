  summary: "Jane Eyre follows the experiences of its eponymous heroine, including her growth to adulthood and her love for Mr. Rochester. After a difficult childhood as an orphan living with her cruel aunt and at a harsh charity school, Jane becomes governess at Thornfield Hall, where she falls in love with her enigmatic employer, Edward Rochester. When she discovers his existing marriage to the insane Bertha Mason, Jane flees, finding shelter and family with the Rivers family. After refusing a loveless marriage proposal from her cousin St. John Rivers, Jane returns to Rochester, now blind and maimed from a fire set by his wife, who has since died. With social and financial independence secured by an inheritance, Jane accepts Rochester's marriage proposal, entering a union of equals.",
