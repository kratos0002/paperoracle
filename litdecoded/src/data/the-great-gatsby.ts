  summary: "Narrator Nick Carraway moves to Long Island and becomes neighbors with the mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby, who hosts lavish parties while pining for Nick's cousin, Daisy Buchanan. As their lives intertwine, Nick discovers that Gatsby's wealth and persona were cultivated solely to win back Daisy, whom he loved before the war but lost due to his poverty. Their reunion leads to tragedy when Daisy's husband Tom discovers the affair, resulting in death, disillusionment, and the shattering of Gatsby's dream, revealing the emptiness behind the glittering faÃ§ade of 1920s high society.",
